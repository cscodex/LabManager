# 🔧 Latest Deployment Fixes

## Issues Fixed in Commit `0313101`

### 1. ✅ **Duplicate dotenv Entry**
**Problem**: Package.json had two `dotenv` entries causing build warnings
**Solution**: Removed duplicate entry, kept the newer version (^17.2.2)

### 2. ✅ **Missing Replit Plugins**
**Problem**: Vite config was importing Replit plugins that aren't available in production
**Solution**: Updated vite.config.ts to:
- Conditionally load Replit plugins only in development
- Gracefully handle missing plugins in production
- Skip Replit plugins entirely when NODE_ENV=production

### 3. ✅ **Build Process Verified**
**Status**: Build tested locally and working perfectly
- ✅ Vite build completes successfully
- ✅ ESBuild bundles server code
- ✅ No dependency errors
