# Laboratory Management System Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
**System-Based Approach**: Following Material Design principles with inspiration from Canvas LMS and Google Classroom for academic interface patterns. This utility-focused application prioritizes efficiency and learnability for educational workflows.

## Core Design Elements

### A. Color Palette
**Light Mode:**
- Primary: #1976D2 (academic blue)
- Secondary: #388E3C (success green) 
- Background: #FAFAFA (light grey)
- Text: #212121 (dark grey)
- Accent: #FF5722 (attention orange)
- Warning: #FFC107 (amber)

**Dark Mode:**
- Primary: #2196F3 (lighter academic blue)
- Secondary: #4CAF50 (brighter success green)
- Background: #121212 (dark grey)
- Text: #E0E0E0 (light grey)
- Accent: #FF7043 (softer attention orange)
- Warning: #FFD54F (lighter amber)

### B. Typography
- **Primary Font**: Roboto for UI elements and data
- **Secondary Font**: Open Sans for body text and descriptions
- **Hierarchy**: H1 (24px), H2 (20px), H3 (18px), Body (16px), Caption (14px)
- **Weights**: Regular (400), Medium (500), Semi-bold (600)

### C. Layout System
- **Spacing Units**: Consistent use of 4, 8, 16, and 24px (Tailwind: p-1, p-2, p-4, p-6)
- **Grid**: 12-column responsive grid with sidebar navigation
- **Breakpoints**: Mobile-first responsive design optimized for desktop and tablet

### D. Component Library

**Navigation:**
- Persistent sidebar with collapsible sections
- Top navigation bar with user profile and notifications
- Breadcrumb navigation for deep hierarchies

**Data Display:**
- Card-based layout for lab sessions and student information
- Tabular presentation for grades and analytics with sorting/filtering
- Status badges for submission states (submitted, graded, pending)
- Progress indicators for lab completion

**Forms:**
- Rubric builders with draggable criteria
- File upload zones with drag-and-drop functionality
- Grade input fields with validation and auto-calculation
- Calendar schedulers for lab session timing

**Feedback & Grading:**
- Inline comment system with threading
- Grade distribution visualizations
- Student performance charts and analytics dashboards
- Printable report generation interface

**Core Interactions:**
- Hover states for interactive elements
- Loading states for data-heavy operations
- Success/error toast notifications
- Modal dialogs for detailed views and confirmations

### E. Academic-Specific Patterns
- **Grade Books**: Spreadsheet-like interfaces with cell editing
- **Submission Workflows**: Clear visual progression from assignment to grading
- **Student Rosters**: Photo grids with quick access to individual profiles
- **Lab Schedule**: Calendar views with time slot availability
- **Analytics Dashboards**: Chart-heavy interfaces showing performance trends

## Key Design Principles
1. **Clarity First**: Information hierarchy supports quick decision-making
2. **Academic Context**: Visual cues align with educational terminology and workflows
3. **Efficiency**: Minimize clicks for common instructor tasks
4. **Scalability**: Interface handles varying class sizes gracefully
5. **Accessibility**: High contrast ratios and keyboard navigation support

This design system emphasizes functional clarity over visual flourishes, ensuring instructors can efficiently manage their lab sessions while maintaining a professional, academic appearance that students and administrators will recognize and trust.
